    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s first understand our task. The problem we want to solve is that we want to predict an individual’s income based on information provided of that individual, such as age, education, occupation, hours per week they work etc. We only want to know if they make more than 50K or not. So the outcome of our program will be, say 0 if <=50K or 1 if >50K, a binary classification. So we can say that our problem is of binary classification. So we will be looking at classification algorithm to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to solve this problem, we have many classification algorithms, some are mentioned below with brief description:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tNaive Bayes Classifier : It works on probability. It is also called probabilistic classifier. The formula for it is : P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B). Using this formula we can calculate the probability of A happening, given B has already happened. This model is used for spam email classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tDecision Trees : They have structures like trees. One way to imagine this algorithm is to think of conditional control statements. A decision tree has a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents some condition, and each leaf node represents class label. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tEnsemble methods : These methods work by combining weak models into a strong model. We usually use decision trees as weak models. Some of these methods are :\n",
    "\n",
    "    a.\tBagging : In Bagging we first create weak learners, and then combine them by voting or averaging. By doing this we get a strong learner. Here we train on small random samples of the dataset.\n",
    "    b.\tAdaBoost : In AdaBoost, the algorithm trains on the original dataset, and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but now focuses on misclassified points more, that means tries to correctly classify those misclassified points.\n",
    "    c.\tRandomForest : In this method we create each weak learner by training on some random features or columns of the dataset. So we if we have n number of features in the dataset, then we will chose k number of features randomly, where k < n. After getting some models, we combine them by averaging their predictions.\n",
    "    d.\tGradient Boosting : It works same as AdaBoost, but it uses a loss function to calculate the error. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tK – Nearest Neighbors : It works by assuming that similar things tends to be near to each other. It is very easy to implement but as the number of examples increase, the algorithm gets slower. Here K is a number that represents number of neighbors that will be used to determine the class of the point. K will be a positive number. We will use odd number for K if we want to solve 2  class problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tStochastic Gradient Descent Classifier : It is an optimization method. It is used to optimize a model, such as LR or SVM. We first use some function to calculate the error, and then through each iteration of learning, we try to minimize the error. But it requires too many hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\tSVM : SVM provides an optimal hyperplane which splits the points in different category. For a 2 dimensional space, this hyperplane is a line that divides the plane in two parts where each part describes a class. The separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tLogistic Regression : It is a predictive analysis, and is used to describe data and explain the relationship between a dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables. It uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. This dependent variable can have two possible values, such as pass or fail, or in our case <=50K or >50K.\n",

    "The model we have chosen is _GradientBoostingClassifier_. The algorithm works by combining several weak learners to create a strong learner that can predict if an individual makes more than 50K or not. GradientBoostingClassifier uses Decision Trees to train weak learners. Let us first understand what are Decision Trees. Decision Trees are flow chart like structures. Here each internal node represents a condition or a test. And each leaf node holds a class label. In decision trees, we ask questions to predict something. These predictions will be our classification of individuals. A simple decision tree will look like this :"

    "In boosting techniques such as AdaBoost or GradientBoosting, we first train a simple decision tree on our dataset. This first model will correctly identify some people as having income >50K. And it will miss some as well. Then we will create another tree so we can correctly identify individuals who have income >50k by using a loss function. Loss function is just a way for us to calculate error in our model. We will use this loss function to improve our model. We will create some of these trees, that try to identify individual's income correctly. All of these trees are our weak learners. They are just better than random guesses. They can be very much accurate also. \n",

    "Now how do we combine these weak learners? So say we have data of a new individual whose income we want to predict. We will have our weak learners vote on what they think the income of the individual will be or average them out. That is how we combine our weak learners. This is how our model will work."

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

    "I got 4 out of 5 columns right albeit not in correct order. The graph above shows that age matters the most in our dataset with gradient boosting classifier, I tried using other classifiers as well and it shows different feature set for different algorithm. It is interesting. I will have to play with different algorithm and different feature set to see how they affect the accuracy of the model. So for the model we are using, i.e. GradientBoostingClassifier, age seems to be the most important factor. I did not give much importanace to hours per week column, but it seems it also plays an important part in our model to make prediction. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
